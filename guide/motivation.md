# Motivation

This guide was created with the purpose to serve as source of objective information for IT Pros and Sysadmins on the main topics about Azure. It is being created in a open source model. For this reason it is being created in GitHub and under the terms of the GNU General Public License 3.0.

It will be based on the official Microsoft documentation contained in http://docs.microsoft.com/azure, but geared to the infrastructure and operations teams.

In my daily life with clients working as Cloud Solution Architect, I have noticed that many IT Pros have a large knowledge gap in Azure. In many cases, they have partial or incomplete information because they learn Azure on demand, in an unorganized or unstructured way without following a logical path of study and learning.

Also, with the growth of the DevOps culture, IT Pro's and classic system administrators still not very familiar with DevOps cannot benefit from the benefits that this adoption can bring to their teams. So I decided to create this guide to serve as a reference for these IT Pro's and system administrators who need to learn more about Azure in a structured way and how to align this learning with the evolution of these professionals in the adoption of DevOps and introduction to CloudOps.
